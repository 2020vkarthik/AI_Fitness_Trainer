# DiagnoAI : Your personal Fitness Assistant
In recent years, the healthcare industry has increasingly integrated artificial intelligence (AI) to improve personalized care. This project presents a healthcare recommendation system that 
automatically produces diet plans and fitness exercises tailored according to user-reports of symptoms. By using the smart machine learning algorithms that scan the input symptoms and correlate to proposed
lifestyle adjustments, it puts an even more proactive role in the management of health. Our proposed model is to give users more convenient and tailored health recommendations so that the gap between visits to 
conventional care services and daily health care maintenance is filled. The model is conceived in terms of accuracy, relevance, and appropriateness using user-friendly terms for diversified user needs.
The early stages of the findings show high precision in aligning recommendations to guidelines, thus setting up this solution as a rich source for furthering individual wellness and preventive care.
